# GTK Cookbook
Collection of GTK3 GUI programs for practice.

Developed with glade, focused on gtk api and functioning across operating systems.

# Systems Tests:

Developing these programs co-incides with systems programming practice. Thus, I have a slight focus on code differences between unix && dos etc. For example, fork() vs. process spawn, multithreading, IPC etc.
